  <p>Bluebird (Harper Row) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.<br>
    She is a supporting character of Batman. Harper Row was created by writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo,
    first appearing in Batman vol. 2, #7 (March 2012), before debuting as Bluebird in Batman #28 (February 2014).
    Harper Row's Bluebird identity was designed by artist Dustin Nguyen. Within the fictional DC Universe,
    Harper Row officially joins Batman's group of allies during the events of Batman Eternal, a year-long weekly maxiseries. <br>
    Instead of taking on the mantle of Robin, which is traditionally that of Batman's sidekick,
    Harper Row instead adopts an entirely new superhero identity, Bluebird.<br>
    Her appearance marks the arrival of the first new "Bat-family" character in Batman
    comics since DC relaunched its entire line in 2011 as part of its The New 52 publishing event.
